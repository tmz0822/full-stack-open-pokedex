The language that I picked is JavaScript.

1. Linting: ESLint is used to enforce coding standards and catch possible issues in the codes.
2. Testing: The testing framework that I have experience with are Mocha, Jest and Cypress.
3. Building: Using webpack to bundle the JavaScript codes.

There are many alternatives to Jenkins and Github Actions such as Travis CI, CircleCI and GitLab CI/CD.

There are many factors that should be considered to decide between self-hosted or cloud-based environment such as budget, expertise, scalability, integration and security. I would say this setup will be better in a cloud-based environment because it's an application being worked by 6 people, it may not be a huge software project.
